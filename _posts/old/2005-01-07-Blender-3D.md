It has been a long time since I added anything to my blog. I want to write a bit about J2EE and PHP and a ton of other things. 

While looking at [this page from the GNU Software Foundation](http://www.gnu.org/software/for-windows.html), I found some very interesting programs that I did not know about. The one that really caught my attention was [Blender 3D](http://www.blender.org/), which is a 3D video rendering program. I will run under Windows, Linux and OSX among other Operating systems. It looked really impressive although I did not have the time to experement with it and play with it myself.

The other program that I noticed was [Sodipodi](http://www.sodipodi.com/), which is a verctor rendering program.

These programs were listed amongst some other more well-known projects such as [Open Office](http://www.openoffice.org/).
