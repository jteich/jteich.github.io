Installed on open source, free anti-virus package called [ClamAV](http://www.clamav.net/). I compiled it with --enable-milter so I should be able to use Sendmail to automagically check ever email. On RedHat Linux, I had to install the sendmail-devel package in order to do this since I needed the libmilter packages for it to compile.
